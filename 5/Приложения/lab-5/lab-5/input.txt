I have been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams I have kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes I can see it in your smile
You're all I have ever wanted and my arms are open wide
Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much, I love you
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I have just got to let you know
Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven not got a clue
But let me start by saying, I love you
